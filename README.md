# INF2440-Oblig3
Assignment I did back in 2014 for Effective Parallel Programming class.

I am currently refactoring the code daily for fun.

## TODO
- [ ] remove the swap between arrays in the threads. If I pass the arrays it should remove the problem.
- [x] ~~remove duplicated sync method~~
- [x] ~~eliminate need for digit number in parallel radix~~
- [x] ~~End parallel sort with a join~~
- [ ] Remove nested classes:
- [ ] Pass barrier to threads
- [ ] Create methods for altering values
- [ ] Pass parent object
- [ ] Translate everything to 1 language

## Notes
* Test if more efficient to keep nested class structure
